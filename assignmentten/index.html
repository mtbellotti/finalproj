       <div class="col-5"> <p>It’s the story we keep hearing- inflation is steady and rate cuts are coming. But why is consumer spending on the rise? Well the story from quarter one data shows a different story.
        Gross domestic product- a broad measure of goods and services- in the first quarter, increased at a 1.6% annualized pace, below the 2.4% estimate. Retail sales increased 0.7% for the month, considerably faster than the Dow Jones forecast of a 0.3% increase. </p>

        <p> This firm inflation from the first quarter has called into question whether the Federal Reserve will be able to lower interest rates like they planned in May. Speaking on a panel discussion earlier this month, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said that while inflation pressure has eased in the last year, it hasn’t come down in recent months. This means that the Fed isn’t confident that inflation is headed to its 2% target level. </p>

     <div class="row">
       <div class="col"><p>Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for anything from mortgages to credit cards and encourages consumers to save rather than spend, which in theory helps bring down prices. But it takes a while for the effects to be felt and the risk that the Central Bank raises to the point where the economy slows down and tilts into a recession. </p>

       </div> <p>The consumer price index also increased 0.4%. This means that consumers more than kept up with the pace of inflation, which ran at a 3.5% annual rate for the month. Resilient consumer spending is helping keep the economy afloat despite higher interest rates and concerns over stubborn inflation. Consumer spending accounts for nearly 70% of U.S. economic output. If we look at this on a smaller scale and focus on the state of Connecticut, we can see that in 2020, consumer spending was down -7.12%. There was then a steep increase by 2021, up to 13.1%. This rise continued into last year where it laid at 30.3%.</p>

   <div class="col-5">  <p>Now to understand the spending habits of Connecticut we have to understand its economy more. In March 2008, the number of jobs on business’ payrolls in Connecticut reached a total of 1.72 million. The state had never had that many positions- and has never had as many since then. Today, Connecticut’s economy still has not fully recovered from the Great Recession. It is only one of four states- alongside West Virginia, Wyoming and Vermont- that had fewer jobs at the end of 2023 than in March 2008. For Connecticut, the reasons for its struggles with job growth are more complex. Like many rural states, it has seen low population growth in the past decade and a half. The state has also continually grappled with a high cost of living and doing business. A business owner in Connecticut, ___ spoke about the cost of living there “____. ”
    <p>If we dissect where exactly consumers are spending money, you can see a big chunk of it is going to Health care and social assistance (HCS) spending. There is also a big amount going towards retail spending and merchandise and apparel- a testament to the all around high cost of living in the constitution state. </p>
